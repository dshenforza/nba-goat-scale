    #### Description: 
    For my CS50P Final Project, I have created a tongue-in-cheek statistical analysis tool for NBA Fans.

    The GOAT Scale allows NBA fans (also known as 'ball knowers') to compare any NBA player of their choice
    against my personal list of 10 Greatest Players of All Time who are retired. Of course LeBron James will
    one day be on the list, but he is still active. That list of 10, in no particular order, is as follows:

    Michael Jordan
    Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
    Kobe Bryant
    Magic Johnson
    Larry Bird
    Oscar Robertson
    Wilt Chamberlain
    Bill Russell
    Tim Duncan
    Shaquille O'Neal

    These players, as well as the player selected by the user, will be compared only on the tradtitional counting
    statistics of points, rebounds and assists, as well as their per game average for each of those statistics.

    This list is in no way authoritative, and just a fun way to practice engaging with APIs as well as the pandas libary.
